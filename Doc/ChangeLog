Version 1.0.0: Nov 25, 2017

    * transition to CMake
    * tested on many compilers (gcc 4.9 to 7.2 on Linux, clang 8 and gcc 6.2.0 on
        the Mac, xlc 13.01 on IBM Power)
    * changed printf formats in Demo/ to silence warnings from older compilers
    * complex.h in gcc-6.2.0 on the Mac doesn't #define CMPLX; added to usercomplex.h
    * mergesort removed, quicksort performance improved
    * performance improvement for masked matrix-matrix multiply
    * bug fix for masked matrix-matrix multiply. In 0.5.0 only the Mask
        structure was used, not the values.  The spec requires the values of
        the Mask.  This is a bug but into only affects masked matrix multiply
        when the Mask has explicit zero entries.

Version 0.5.0: Nov 13, 2017

    * resolved icc -O3 segfault: Intel compiler bug fixed icc version 18.0
    * added triangle-counting demo in C (Demo/tricount.c) and MATLAB
        (Test/tricount.m).  See also Test/test69, Test/test70. and Test/test71.
    * performance enhancements to GrB_eWiseMult, GrB_assign, GrB_subassign,
        GrB_extract, and GrB_mxm, reducing time and memory.  mxm now exploits
        the mask during computation, to save memory and often saving time.
        This is essential for good performance for triangle counting.
    * reduced Test/testall.m and Tcov/testcov.m testing time from 2 hours to
        15 minutes, maintained 100% test coverage

Version 0.4.0: Oct 24, 2017

    * SPEC: SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS 0.4.0 fully conforms to 1.1.0 of the spec
    * GrB_assign functions added; all now conform to the 1.1.0 spec 
    * renamed all prior GrB_*_assign functions to GrB_*_subassign

Version 0.3.0: Oct 14, 2017

    * changes for spec 1.1.0
    * performance improvement of GrB_mxm, GrB_mxv, transpose, GrB_reduce;
        added workspace kept internally, reused for subsequent calls to
        GraphBLAS
    * performance improvement of bfs in Demo (v held as dense vector)
    * performance improvement of GrB_assign when A is a scalar
    * performance improvement of C<M>= ... mask operation
    * GrB_Column_extract and GrB_Column_assign renamed GrB_Col_*
        to match changes in the spec
    * changed GrB_*_setElement and GrB_*_extractTuples to match the spec
    * added GrB_INSUFFICIENT_SPACE error code for GrB_*_extractTuples
    * added GrB_INVALID_HANDLE
    * GrB_assign still does not match the spec (in progress).
        It differs on how it treats entries outside C(I,J), and it differs
        in the size and interpretation of the Mask.

Version 0.2.0: Sept 5, 2017

    * No significant change to the code; but preparing for wider release
    * content of GrB_stddef.h moved into Include/GraphBLAS.h and file removed
    * User Guide updated (SPEC discussion)
    * GraphBLAS.h modified (SPEC discussions)
    * Licensed under Apache 2.0; versions 0.1.x were limited releases
    * removed wathen_mod.m (to see it do 'type private/wathen' in MATLAB)

Version 0.1.2: Aug 30, 2017

    * added (double) to fpclassify in CAST macro, to silence
        spurious errors in gcc
    * minor typos
    * icc -O3 causes a segfault when compiling GB_AxB_builtin.c, so
        Lib/GraphBLAS_config.mk now uses -O2 with icc.
    * some versions of gcc have trouble finding libgraphblas.so.0
        when compiling the Demo (if GraphBLAS is not installed with
        'make install').  Instead of requiring a 'make install'
        static linking is now used for the Demo programs.  This
        has no effect on the GraphBLAS library itself.
    * changes for GraphBLAS spec 1.0.2 (Aug 10, 2017 version):
        * GrB_Vector_reduce_Monoid renamed to GrB_Matrix_reduce_Monoid
        * GrB_Vector_reduce_BinaryOp renamed to GrB_Matrix_reduce_BinaryOp
        * GrB_Row_extract was renamed in the spec to GrB_Col_extract, but 
            this version keeps the name GrB_Column_extract since it parallels
            the name GrB_Column_assign.

Version 0.1.1: Aug 28, 2017

    * minor changes to Makefiles and GraphBLAS_config.mk
    * port to Linux with gcc 4.9.3, 5.40, and 6.3.0
    * minor code changes to silence spurious gcc warnings;
        (&Ax[i]) changed to (Ax +(i)).
    * bug fix to GB_assign1.c (apply_pending_updates variable)

Version 0.1.0: July 31, 2017

    * first version released; only to GraphBLAS API Committee
